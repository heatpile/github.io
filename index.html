                <p>Goal of the "HEATPILE" is to provide an alternative to the use of biomass and as an off-grid solution.</p>
                <p>Many places face problems as deforestation, respiratory issues and lack of biomass for fuel. Additionally, regions at high altitudes, with cold climate and plenty of sunlight, could benefit from a system like this (Nepal, Afghanistan, Peru).</p>
                <p>The project is the product of a postgraduate thesis, and it hasn't been constructed nor tested. 
                Only simulations have been used to estimate if the cooking part of the system works, which were positive.
                The collecting-absorbing part of the system is based on similar scientific articles which are able to produce high temperatures (e.g. dish diameter, principle of absorber).
                Electrical power is needed to operate the air blower and the solar tracker, which guides the collector.</p>

                <p>Atmospheric air is heated from the sun in the focal point of the mirror.</p>
                <p>This air is used to heat a pile of concrete blocks (actual building debris, in fact, ideally each at the size of a fist), kept insulated inside the pyramidal tank.</p>

                <p>The cooking vessel, placed in the stove, is dipped in sand. As the hot air is blown in the sand, it aerates it and the whole emulsion rises the temperature of the pot.
                You can think of it as a bain-marie, consisting of air and sand instead of liquid water.</p>

                <p>It is the control unit of the system. In the idle position (middle), the system is set at the loading phase.
                Turned to one side, the cooking procedure is set, and the lever locks in place. The air path is turned to be guided in the cooking unit and the blower is set to high speed with a switch.
                Turned on the other side, at the heating mode, the air is driven from the pile and into the house and the blower is set at low (The image above shows the insides of the mechanism).</p>

                <h3 class="text-center">Idle phase</h3>
                <p>The loading process begins as soon as a photoresistor detects the first daylight. Automatically the blower is set at low mode and the parabolic mirror is turned at the sun. The operation stops at the end of the day and pauses with the use of an oven thermostat.</p>
                <p>1. The concentrated radiation heats up the absorber, which is consisted of 3 layers of hemispherical stainless steel mesh colanders, the one inside the other, like a babushka.
                This array is housed inside a stainless steel chimney hat. An opening is made in the center of the colanders, for the air to pass easier down to the pipe.</p>
                <p>2. The hot air is sucked down the stainless steel stove pipe with the help of a blower (fireplace centrifugal air fan). 
                The air then enters the pyramidal chamber at the bottom in order to flow through the pile of the rocks and heat them.</p>
                <p>3. As the air has nowhere else to go, it exits from the pipe at the chamber's ceiling. This exiting pipe includes the entering pipe inside of it.
                It exhaust the used air a bit lower from the starting point of the absorber, in order to reduce the temperature difference and hence insulate the absorber.</p>

                <p>When the user wants to heat the house, he turns a lever indoors, which closes the previous ceiling air exit and opens the one next to it (those doors are consisted of dampers used for regulating or shutting the air flow in stove pipes).
                At the same time, the blower is activated at the low mode.</p>
                <p>1. Fresh air is sucked in (during nighttime or heated air during the day), in order to get heated from the hot rocks.</p>
                <p>2. The air then is driven inside the house, through an insulated pipe.</p>

                <p>Strictly during daytime, when the system is able to cook food, the user can turn the lever at the opposite position.
                The blower is then set at high mode.</p>
                <p>RED LINE: The heated air from the absorber, is driven now directly inside the house, to the cooking unit of the system.</p>
                <p>ORANGE LINE: After the air depositing the heat to the pot through the fluidized sandbath, it exhausts back in the pyramidal chamber. This pipe includes the entering air pipe, in order to insulate it thermally (similarly with the idle phase).</p>

                <p>The hot air enters in the plenum, just below the sand. The air then passes through the stainless steel sieve and into the sand. The sieve stands on a metal holed grid, and heat resistant silicon ring inbetweens.</p>
                <p>A second silicon ring, part of the unit, is between the pot and the walls, in order to prevent the air to escape and to drive it to the exhaust pipe.</p>
